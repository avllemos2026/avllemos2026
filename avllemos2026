<h1>About the Creator</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Aaliyah Llemos, the creator of this website! My absolute favorite hobby is reading. With all the ruckus going on in my life, reading books helps me get away from it all. Which is why the purpose of this website is to introduce authors that you may not know about yet. Not only did I include the names of these authors, but some of their books that I think you could enjoy! Some of the authors I put are Colleen Hoover (my absolute favorite!), Ana Huang, Jasmine Warga, and a lot more! If you would like to contact me to communicate with me your concerns or ideas or you want me to add more authors and their books, please email me at aaliyahv.llemos@gmail.com, you are more than welcome to do so, I believe that it would help me make this website more purposeful for other viewers. Thank you!</p>
