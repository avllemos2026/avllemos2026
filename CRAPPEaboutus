  <p>Since 1977, our customers have loved Crappe and what its become to be.</p>
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Our present cafe, started as a stand in front of our creator's house when she was just 8 years old, Renee Marie Warner. As a young African-American girl in her time, she dreamed of opening a cafe open to all races, genders, and occupations without them feeling guilty and ashamed of who they are, but rather comfortable and happy with their identities. On March 18, 1977 Renee opened her cafe and was even able to hire employees that carried out her purpose and make her establishment a comfortable and safe space that is open to any customer. Her family spread the news all over her hometown and increased profit and reputation. After one year of opening, Marie was able to expand her business and spread her mission all over Massachusetts. She was able to open more branches outside her state several years later.</p><br>
  <p>In 2002, Renee sadly passed away but not before passing on the business to her daughter, Elizabeth "Liz" Warner. She continued on her mother's mission and further developed the original cafe and its branches. She updated the style from a bold and colorful cafe to a vintage rustic one to better suit the name. She expanded the business and made international branches within the western hemisphere. With the help of her workers, she was also able to hire staff that had the same motives as her and her mother.</p><br>
  <p>In 2008, Liz retired and passed on the business to her daughter, Beatrice Marie Warner. As a woman in her mid-20s running a cafe, she was successful in maintaing the cafe's legacy and even increased profit. She expanded both the menu and the company, opening brances in the Southern part of the world. The first branch opened in Singapore, and from there, reached China, Korea, Malaysia, and more. She retired five years after running the business and passed it on her ambitious friend, Annabeth Stan.</p><br>
  <p>Our cafe has always aspired to be different from the rest, with not only a profit motive but also a humane one.</p><br>

  <p>The Philippines was able to get a taste of Crappe on September 14, 2011. Ever since, our staff in the Philippines have also kept the mission of the cafe from 1977 and used it to guide them in running the establishments on the other side of the original cafe.</p>
